Ruby gems are packages of code that you can use in your Ruby projects. You can find them on RubyGems.org. 

The purpose of gems are to make your life easier. Instead of writing code from scratch, you can use a gem that someone else has already written. 

Here are some examples of gems:

<ul>
  <li>Nokogiri - A gem that allows you to parse HTML and XML documents.</li>
